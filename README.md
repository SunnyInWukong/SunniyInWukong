## About Me
Hello, my name is **Brett Knox**, and I’m a Data Science student at the **University of North Florida**, expecting to graduate with my bachelor’s degree by **Spring 2026**.  

I founded and manage a creative workshop called **F.O.R.G.E.** (*Fellowship of Research, Gadgets, & Engineering*), where the focus is on helping S.T.E.M. students apply what they’ve learned in innovative and practical ways.  

While much of my coursework is centered on data science, my personal projects extend into **engineering, electronics, and robotics**, reflecting my passion for building, experimenting, and applying knowledge to real-world challenges.

### Fundamentals & Practice
- [**Python Practice (Data Structures & Algorithms)**](https://github.com/SunnyInWukong/Python-Practice)  
  A collection of Python implementations of core data structures and algorithms, including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.  
  The goal of this repository is to strengthen understanding of algorithmic efficiency, memory usage, and traversal methods while maintaining clean, reusable code.  
  <!-- Add notes on coverage: sorting/searching algorithms, recursion, complexity analysis, etc. -->
  <!-- Consider expanding README inside the repo with explanations and usage examples for each structure -->
