## About Me
Hello, my name is Brett Knox and i'm a data science student at the University of North Florida, expecting to get my bachelors degree by spring of 2026.
I started and manage a creative workshop called the "Fellowship of Research, Gadgets, & Engineering" or F.O.R.G.E.,  where the main objective is to have S.T.E.M. students apply what they've learned in creative ways.
While much of my studying is data-related, many of my personal projects are more engineering / robotics adjacen as i am passionate about creating new things & applying what i've learned to my daily life.
